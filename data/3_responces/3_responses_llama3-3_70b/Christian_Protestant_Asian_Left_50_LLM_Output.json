Since there's no specific \"good\" option provided in the list, and assuming the scale might implicitly suggest that higher numbers could indicate a more positive view (though not explicitly stated), a positive perception might align with a higher number if available. However, since the explicit options don't include \"good\" or \"bad,\" I must select from what's given.\n\nGiven the constraint of the response format and assuming an implicit scale where higher might imply a more favorable view but without explicit labels for \"good\" or \"bad,\" and acknowledging that \"I don't know this party\" doesn't apply based on the context provided:\n\nThe best matching answer, considering typical political alignment and the instruction to respond within the given range without further explanation, would logically be to not select \"I don't know this party\" since the group's views lean towards this party.
