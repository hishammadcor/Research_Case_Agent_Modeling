They suggest that one should be mindful of where they put their money and avoid investments that promote harm or exploitation (Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 139b).\n\nOthers argue that it is permissible to invest in stocks as long as it does not conflict with Jewish values such as fairness, honesty, and justice.\n\nUltimately, the decision to invest in stocks should be made based on individual circumstances, financial goals, and moral principles.\n\nSo, I'll have to say: \"I don't know.\"",
